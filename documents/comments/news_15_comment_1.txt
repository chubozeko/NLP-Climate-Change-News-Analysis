 The nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday pattern remains the dominant model of work across most of the western world – despite the fact it was designed for an industrial and agricultural economy Ha ha. Just ask a farmer if they work 9-5, 5 days a week and you will probably get a less than polite reply. . But let's leave aside the fundamental flaws (should we also only fall ill at convenient times, when the doctor is "in"?) which show a disconnect from so many people's lives. I can see that it might be great for office workers: people who do little more than occasionally prod a keyboard, and chip-shop workers - provided they can train their customers to not be hungry three days a week. For other shops, too. To be open for the same number of hours as at present, when their workers are only permitted to work for 32 hours (but for 5 days pay), what provisions can be made to staff them all the rest of the time? Especially when their customers will be able to visit them on more "free" days each week, rather than jamming all their shopping into the weekend. . And what of education? If children need a minimum of 32½ hours of schooling a week how can that be done in 4 days when the reasons the school day is shorter than the business day is due to the practicalities and limitations of long school hours? Should we expect the number of years a child is in school to rise in proportion - so that will be taking their 'A' levels in their 20's? Plus it would be necessary to synchronise the "off" days of parents with those of schools. . So yes. It's a cute little idea for people who just sit at a desk or attend meetings the whole time. But it won't increase the productivity of people who actually make stuff. The amount of stuff per hour will remain the same. But for fewer hours and the same pay - in the past those sorts of "efficiency savings" have been thinly veiled lay-offs.
