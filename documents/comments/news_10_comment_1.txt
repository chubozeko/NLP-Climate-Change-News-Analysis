Cutting down our carbon emissions and fossil fuel reliance in our economies will be difficult and not easy without huge socio-economic impacts. However, cutting down the use of private jets (or heavily taxing them) is surely one of the easiest ways, and certainly the least likely to affect most people. Some of the famous examples are appalling, made even worse by the fact that many of the wealthier in society are often preaching about environmental issues, whilst still travelling unnecessarily by private jet.
