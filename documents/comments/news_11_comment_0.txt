Thanks Andy. Another voice in the wilderness saying that it doesn't have to be this way. It can be a sustainable, or at least MORE sustainable, and ecologically friendly way. On the optimistic side, the voices rubbishing the huge switch we have to make to save the planet and save ourselves are fewer and quieter; individual voices that is, institutional and corporate voices are another matter. We are taking a long time because this is the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. It puts the US's, China's and Russia's current gun readiness in an anachronistic light. Think where we would be if all those billions that go into arms manufacture and war readiness went into saving ourselves and the planet.....
