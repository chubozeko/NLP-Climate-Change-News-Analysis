It's time for my annual "How to trick or treat in Australia" rules 1). Do it locally. Don’t just drive to a “Halloween street”. The only thing that stops it from being a goodies grab is the fact you get to know your community, and that is really lovely 2) Letterbox! Put a flyer in every letterbox in the street that they can display if they are happy to have people knock. Advantages are your kids won’t knock on aggressive peoples doors, and people can just take it in when they’ve run out of lollies. (I know most people just use the decorated houses, but I still think this is better) 3) Teach your kids the basic history of Halloween, as there is normally one smartarse who will quiz them. 4). Dress up yourself. It’s fun 5) teach your kids before you go ONE thing at each house, and say thankyou 6) If there is no sign people are into it, don't knock 7) (adults only) bring a wine glass with you. Many sympathetic houses will fill it up. (Please note: many states have no drinking alcohol on footpaths, so check first)
