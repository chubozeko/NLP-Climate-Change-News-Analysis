Look on websites such as flightradar24.com and the skies are full of private jets over Britain and Europe. We have a very comprehensive range of flights from British airports to almost all European and US destinations. Why on Earth do these celebrities and business executives need these business jets? It's because they're a symbol of the status they've reached or achieved, nothing more. Their purchase and usage should be heavily taxed. But when our Foreign Secretary, soon to be Prime Minister (if the opinion polls are correct) boasts of having spent tens of thousands flying in an executive jet rather than use scheduled flights to far-off places then the Tories simply will not take such measures. I read recently that executive jet charters cost anything between £10,000 and £20,000 and hour. That's our taxpayers money they're spending, not to mention the pollution and climate factors. They really are hypocrites.
