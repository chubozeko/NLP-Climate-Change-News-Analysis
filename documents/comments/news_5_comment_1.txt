Australia doesn’t need elaborate new “market mechanisms” to save our precious environment. We just need to stop approving new housing developments where koalas still like to live, or new mines where platypuses live. And we need to stop the approval of the 116 coal and gas projects currently on the books in Australia which will inevitably cause the climate change that most threatens all of our unique species. Yep Surely one day soon we will admit neoliberalism was a disastrous wrong turn and that direct government intervention is the simplest and best way to pursue (what should be) shared values.
