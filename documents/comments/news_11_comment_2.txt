Appreciate your article and your work.  There is no new technology required to harness the benefits of diversity, to grow our food using nature’s regenerative biology rather than today’s destructive chemistry  Absolutely true but I would extend this. There is no new technology required to save the world and give our children a future. We have everything we need. It's stupendously boring, but what's mostly require is a focus on boring technologies. Energy efficiency, regenerative agriculture, efficient transport, sustainable energy generation. ..Magic special new tech to make cows fart less methane which has never been show to work in an actual rumen....and make energy from fusion 96 years after the phenomenon was described....and carbon capture projects that fail utterly. Please. I am a scientist. Sure, give it a go. Happy to be proven wrong, happy for these techs to provide a buffer.  But don't expect us to rely on unproven technologies for the literal survival of our civilisation and our children. We have what we need. Get to work.
