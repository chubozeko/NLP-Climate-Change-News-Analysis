Thank you for writing this. I was brought up short by this stark, cogent reason why we must all help Pakistan now. It is so right to speak of the aftermath -trauma, lives ruined for decades. How many other disasters from last year and the year before have faded into a corner of memory. How many times can we dip into diminished purses to help? For this is not not only going to be a long suffering, but a continuous repeated one, in Pakistan probably and certainly elsewhere. It is not right to say if Ukraine why not Pakistan? Both need support, but Pakistan people are not welcomed as refugees, just as many in the UK including the Home Office did not exactly welcome Ukrainians. It was the large sections of the British people who put pressure on Government to pull their finger out . So large sections of our Muslim Community must up the pressure. Our broadcasters to do their duty to bring us images and ideas of what we can do. Pakistan's leaders also need to get a grip.
