I think it would help the cause of those who wish to preserve these historic buildings, if someone could come up with a sensible way to repurpose them, rather than the existing occupier having the ability to threaten us with leaving another crumbling empty shell irf they dont get their way.  The trouble with our high streets and shopping centers is that they are already too full of ghost spaces. If something constructive could be done with all the empty Debenhams et-al it would make the case for retaining the old buildings like this beautiful M&S branch, independent of whether or not the store decides the buildings are suitable to their current needs.
