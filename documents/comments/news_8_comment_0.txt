Ther should be a global Tobin tax on financial transactions with money raised going to UN to be allocated most effectively (ideally decided by scientists / experts, not politicians) It was suggested a few years ago that a tax of around 1% could raise tens of billions or more per year. Needs to be agreed across wealthier countries (otherwise money” moves elsewhere, as I think Sweden found when they tried it) so perhaps the G7 / G20? It has a moral argument for climate change as the wealthy countries have caused the problems.It could also be used for problems where a worldwide solution is required but poorer countries can’t afford it: for example could have been used to fund COVID vaccines.
