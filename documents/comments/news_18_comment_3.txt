Why wish Javid, Mordaunt, Tugendhat, or Wallace good luck with their ambitions to join the Truss cabinet? If they are as you call them moderates, they would be betraying their principles for a mess of pottage. If they are not why wish them good fortune? Truss shows every sign of being the continuity Johnson candidate in all respects - she lies as easily as she breathes & is already caught up in a financial scandal; if it wasn't Liz's fizz whose was it? Combined with her extremism & economic illiteracy she won't be an improvement on Johnson at all - she could in fact be worse & Tory MPs know that. They are doing the exact same thing with her as they did with Johnson - backing a liability because she is popular with the Tory grass roots. But they can't even argue to themselves that she will be popular with the wider electorate as they do this, which makes what they are doing even worse.  They appear unable to learn from past mistakes which is a dreadful indictment on them & a shocker for the country.
