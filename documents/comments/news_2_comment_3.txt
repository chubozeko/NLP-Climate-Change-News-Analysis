As a scientist who worked on climate change science and policy in NSW for 30 years I share Clive's views and emotions. All his anger, despair and contempt are shared by many of us who understand the science and it's likely environmental, economic and social impacts. Human societies will increasing fall into economic collapse and chaos over the next 50 yrs. We can clearly see it starting in 2022. The only saving grace for me is that I won't be alive to see the worst of the catastrophe. But the young have every right to be extremely angry about what our generation of criminals has left them. I encourage everyone to follow Greta Thumberg and get out on the streets demonstrating and resorting to civil disobediance if necessary. It's their only hope now. And I agree with Clive that the crimes of those responsible in australia, and around the world, should be recorded, for posterity, so that future generations know who was primarily responsible. The criminals are politicians, corporations, lobby groups etc.  And let's not forget all those millions of people who repeatedly voted for the criminals, and believed their lies, because they only cared about their personal bank balance next week, and not about their own childrens future, or any other living thing on this planet.
