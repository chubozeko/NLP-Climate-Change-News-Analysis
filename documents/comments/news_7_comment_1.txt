The 3 months of 9 euro tickets has been a huge success here in Germany. The tickets cover nearly all trains, including the underground, trams and buses. I don't know anyone who hasn't gone and got the tickets, because it makes sense.Sure, some of the trains have been busier as a result, but it is worth it. There are rumours of finding a way to keep the subsidies going; not as cheap, but a good deal nonetheless. At a time where energy prices are soaring, the German Government has given back to everyone, trying to ease the cost of living. This is meaningful to many, available to all. That's government in the best sense of the word.
