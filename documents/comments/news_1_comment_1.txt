What the government fail to realise is that people know that climate change is real. We are experiencing it directly. The UK temperatures this October would have been unthinkable when I was a child. We know some parts of the world are dying in huge numbers because of it, (often countries that have contributed the least to the causes) with no way to help themselves, and we are frightened for future generations everywhere. No amount of government lies or political distractions - driven by their own short term financial gains or political interests - will make us believe that climate change is not real. We know it is. They fail to recognise this at their own peril - and at the cost of the perils they are prepared to inflict on the world for their own short term gain.
