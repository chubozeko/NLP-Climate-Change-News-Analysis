So I see the Maribyrnong river is in flood, and the suburb of the same name is copping it. Will the river rise enough to flood Flemington Racecourse, which is almost directly opposite that suburb? If it does so between now and 1st November, maybe Australia will wake up and take notice of CLIMATE CHANGE. There, I shouted it so everyone can hear.
