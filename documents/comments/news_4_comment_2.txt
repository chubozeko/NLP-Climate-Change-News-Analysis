We should only be building homes that are designed for maximum energy efficiency, but local government are still giving in to developers who aren't doing it. One developer recently got permission for over three hundred homes with gas boilers, because he persuaded the local Council air source heating wasn't cost effective and the boilers would be hydrogen compatible. I have worked on many houses, where the heating systems were so badly designed by the installers, that ten per cent of the heat was devoted to keeping the sub floor warm. Pipes run in front of air bricks on north faces of houses, with no insulation.
