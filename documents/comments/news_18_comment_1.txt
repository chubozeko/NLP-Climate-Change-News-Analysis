If Mordaunt and Tugendhat were smart (and serious) they wouldn't back anyone, sit this one out on the backbenches and wait for the next leader to crash and burn. They could then legitimately claim whatever happens next was nothing to do with them and inherit the (tarnished) crown. I bet that's what the cannier Badenoch does.
