As an American who moved away, Halloween is one of the most benign, joyous, genuine "cultural imperialist" exports I still cling to. It's not even American anyway; try telling a Canadian, for instance, that they only celebrate Halloween because they're suckers for U.S. imperialism and you might walk away with hockey teeth. And if you ever happen to be IN America on Halloween? Find the nearest gay neighborhood and prepare for the party of your life.
