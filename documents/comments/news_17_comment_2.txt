Despite all the evidence, there remains a big gap between the science and public opinion. We have made progress in terms of awareness, but not in terms of action. Most people know about climate change now, but the question is whether they are prepared to make the necessary changes (and sacrifices).  The signs here are not good. Public and government officials will not even talk in detail about what is required for fear of losing elections. Instead they talk about vague overarching terms such as temp increases. They won’t talk about the need to eat less meat, the need to curb travel and the sneed to insulate homes. They know the required action is going involve sacrifice and restriction on people’s lives and, sadly, they know the public won’t vote for that.
