So fossil fuel companies bosses are not “…some cadre of conniving CEOs waking up every morning and deciding to destroy the planet.”? Really? Because every day they decide to continue business as usual, that’s exactly what they are doing.  The fossil fuel industry could put its massive resources, and the huge government subsidies it gets, into green technology and energy production tomorrow if it wanted to. They would not be “booted out” of business if they did.  They are making far too much money; as evidenced by huge director pay packets and shareholder buybacks.  Their greed is going to get a lot of people killed. The evidence is now overwhelming, and can no longer be ignored.
