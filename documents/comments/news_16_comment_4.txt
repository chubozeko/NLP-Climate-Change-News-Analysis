There are always two problems when it comes to discussing issues like this. Firstly, is the widely held misplaced belief that commentators have a good grasp of what the current consequences and near term threats of climate change are. The fossil fuel nations and industry's influence covers politics, the media and even waters down the IPCC. We are already having conditions that would be described in the press as catastrophic and we have sailed past any possibility of remaining below 1.5C and the highest CO2 can be and plausibly remain below 2C is 450ppm CO2 and no it won't drop from where we set the peak. Secondly, the oil companies briefly dallied with idea of pursuing a sustainable future but that ended in the 1990s and were all in a long time back. There are many employees within the companies who care about climate change but not at the board level. What the CEO's care about is not being held to account. Hence all the policies being discussed are orders of magnitude short of what it should be but the slowing of the inadequate policies leaves people thinking token measures would make a difference if only they happened when the reality is that it is not enough.
