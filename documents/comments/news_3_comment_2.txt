Hamfisted vandalism of our economy aside, it is quite astounding how blatant the latest mutation of the ToryKip party is, in its apparent loathing of anything that's green and good in the world. Renewable energy? Ew! Give me fracking any day - it ruins the landscape while you extract the gas, and then ruins the atmosphere when you burn it! Double win! Animal welfare? For snowflakes! Let's remove regulations on how we export live animals (if indeed we do still export anything), and also make it easier to import furs and fois gras! Farming? Was someone going to rethink the form of subsidy in which the ownership of land coverts into free money? How unconservative! Scrap it! There are many more examples. As with the economy, it feels like they are acting out their most damaging, shameful urges as though in a vacuum, to make the most of the (hopefully very short) time that they have left in power.
