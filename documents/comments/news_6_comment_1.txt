New buildings get a tax subsidy. Refurbishing, extending, or even making them more energy efficient to use adds VAT. Demolish it, start again and the VAT miraculously disappears. That is a prime reason why buildings all over the country are being demolished and rebuilt, the government claims it wants to reduce carbon emissions, but adds 20% tax to the costs for anybody who does that by reusing existing buildings.
