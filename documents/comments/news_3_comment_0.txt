 Food and water security, protection from climatic extremes, the carbon cycle, public health and the replenishment of the very air we breathe all depend on nature I'm in complete agreement. We all need more "nature". None more so than the 56 million UK residents who live in towns or cities. . But we should not think of "nature" as something separate from everyday lives or work. It should be integrated into them. So homes should be on large enough plots to fulfil a significant part of that. Roads should be wide enough to provide green space as well as room for pedestrians and traffic - wide enough to eliminate congestion and therefore a significant amount of pollution. Every "block" of houses should have a pond, fed by running and clean water. . Business parks and office locations should accommodate sufficient grounds to provide not just a sanctuary for the people who work in them, but for plentiful plant and animal (and bird and aquatic) life, too. . In short, bring nature closer to people. Not only will it improve their our lives, but it will let people see and value "nature" and then, hopefully, be more sympathetic to its needs.
