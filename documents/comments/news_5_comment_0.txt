I'd like to know why so little attention is paid to the work of convervation NGOs. I mean real conservation NGOs, not the clowns (I won't list the clowns here). Organizations such as Bush Heritage and The Nature Conservancy. They now have quite large areas under conservation management and look like an important future part of biodiversity protection. There are also many smaller organizations doing good work. They are neither market driven nor agents of the state.
