An interesting article. I suspect a lot of how people perceive other's attitudes towards climate change is down to climate disinformation, especially on social media and media organizations like fox news.My other thought is that even with the popular support for climate policies, such policies, if they exist, do more to ensure the profitability of corporations largely responsible for causing, and blocking meaningful action on, climate change than they do to actually reduce emissions, or mitigate the effects of climate change. Hopefully things will change.
