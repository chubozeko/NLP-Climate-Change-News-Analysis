 "That caution was correct..."  By 2007, it absolutely was not correct. In part, it is an issue of what scientifically an attribution study does. It often will give the odds of an event happening if there were no impacts from climate change. To a layperson though this will be misleading for when they are trying to make judgements. It is a bit like if someone hit you with their car when you were crossing the road. The study does the equivalent of rather than assessing whether the driver was responsible will look at the chances of you being run over when you crossed the road. What is clear is that our entire planets weather system has been altered by climate change and the melting poles. Attribution studies only tell you what might have happened if we hadn't done this they don't clear the driver of wrong doing. You will find meterological studies which conclude that extreme events were down to an usual jetstream instead of climate change. But what they don't recognise is that the unusual jetstream was caused by climate change.    ...and understandable...  It is understandable that they have become archconservative. Because they are so pressured and influenced that they are so afraid of being wrong or overstating a threat that they are understating it. The floods in the UK which were at a comparative magnitude or frequency in our records used to be caused by sudden snow melt now it is by single rain events. We still have the ludicrousness of describing floods now happening every 10-20 years as a "1 in 100 year flood"  While tropical storms and hurricanes are uncertain in increasing frequency the impacts of extreme rain and drought events is not in the slightest doubt. It is entirely fundamental thermodynamics, the only uncertainty would be in our observations not the causes.
