Just come back from 10 days in Germany using the 9 euro ticket. We were mainly in Bavaria but travelled hundreds of kilometres visiting six or seven towns as well as Munich. Crucially you could use this ticket on the S-bahn and the U-bahn, and local city buses and trams - which we did. We only had one really crowded journey, and even then it was mainly because our previous train was late so we (and a lot of others) missed a connection. The rest of the time we always had seats or were only standing (most seats taken but not otherwise crowded) for a couple of stops. And because you could use it everywhere except the ICE trains, there was no concern about buying tickets or having the right ticket. You just jumped on the bus.It seemed like everyone had one of these tickets - the ticket inspectors expected it. The first night there, travelling from Munich to Augsburg, I said to an inspector as I was getting the passes up on my phone “we have the 9-euro tickets”. “Ja, natürlich” she replied, smiling.
