  But their presence around the table is unlikely to change the reality, which was also the reality of the Johnson cabinet over the past three years – of a government chosen more for its ideological loyalty than for its ability.   Truss is indeed the continuity Johnson candidate. Expect government to carry on as before, stuffed with sycophants, illusionists, ideologues and the incompetent. Expect the same dysfunctional mess which can only get worse. The country faces rising interest rates, a recession predicted to last well into autumn 2023, inflation at levels not seen for over 40 years, public services that have ceased to work as people have a right to expect, and people angry enough to vote heavily for strike action as a last resort. Messrs Tugendhat, Wallace, Javid and Ms Mordaunt may be rewarded with fancy job titles, a ministerial car and all the trappings and illusions of being a "big shot". But the price will be the inability to act on your own initiative rather than doing as you are told. You will be expected to hit the airwaves, as before, to justify the unjustifiable. It will be for Liz, right, or more often than not, wrong. You know the routine by now. The Tory party, never as competent as its publicity claims, has hit a new low, and will continue to sink to the depths. Out of touch, lacking legitimacy or credibility, this government needs to go, and sooner rather than later. Truss or Sunak? Choose your poison if you are a Tory member. For the rest of us, the antidote will eventually be found at the ballot box in the next general election.
