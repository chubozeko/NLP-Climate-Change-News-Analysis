I am a relatively well off pensioner and I often compare my life to that of my parents. Compared to them I am unbelievably well off. I am comfortably housed, have access to as many books as I can read and as much music as I can listen to. I have a garden to enjoy. There is practically nothing more I want in material terms. Any surplus income I would prefer to be spent on better health care and environmental sustainability because I would like my children to lead a better life than mine, instead of feeling miserably anxious and fearful for the future as they are now. I want a government that recognises this and taxes me accordingly.
