Cop27 must indeed take centre stage as a catalyst for real action on climate change. It does not disappoint me that King Charles will not be attending or speaking at Cop27 - whether or not he was instructed to keep away by the Truss government - because however much I might support his views on the environment, as the constitutional monarch he now needs to keep his political opinions to himself - and the environment (unfortunately) remains a political topic. From some of his recent statements, I believe he understands this as well.
