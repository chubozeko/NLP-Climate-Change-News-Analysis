Excellent, provocative article, and from the comments so far, the subject obviously needs a lot more discussion and serious consideration. I've only seen a few articles on successful plant compatibility, but would like to experiment with more in my garden: e.g. plants which deter slugs next to beans etc. Beside this, the problems with the new droughts, which mean building more microclimates. Difficult to do on the bigger scale: more collectives?
