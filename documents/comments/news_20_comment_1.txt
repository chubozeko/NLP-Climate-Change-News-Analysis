People seem to forget the season is completely inverted and makes no sense in the southern hemisphere. Halloween/Samhain "All Hallows Eve" commemorates the first day of winter and the death of the year. This is completely at odds with what is happening here on this date, it's actually first day of summer/Beltane and celebrates harvest, growth and sunshine - a complete mental disjoint from Halloween. That is why I will never have part of it, we're not in the northern hemisphere and it doesn't apply to us. We also don't need the mindless consumerism and tacky theatrics with commensurate plastic waste.
