Greenpeace ..may God preserve them.. published calculations showing the effect of exploiting the then oil reserves way back in the 80's. If that had been taken seriously we would not be in the mess we are now . A total failure of political imagination coupled with unbridled corruption and greed. All still on show at a Tory Party conference near you.
