People still don't realise how serious this is. We need to communicate these matters more effectively. To explain climate change, I think we need a graphic novel style presentation - 5 graphic novels, one for each IPCC scenario, each involving the same group of characters living through this century, experiencing the different outcomes. Then animated versions would be a bonus. So far, I havn't found anyone interested in doing it - they'd need a good science adviser, but I think there would be takers for that. The 5 scenarios are explained here: https://www.vox.com/22620706/climate-change-ipcc-report-2021-ssp-scenario-future-warming
