There is only one thing that can motivate Big Carbon to co-operate with rolling out sustainable energy and it will work but it will also perpetuate inequality. Their children and their grandchildren cannot rely on fossilised sunlight to make money. It is becoming more expensive and there are security issues when some of the fossilised sunlight is coming from Russia. So eventually the big energy companies will be forced to switch over to sustainable energy not by green laws but by economics and because they need their children to inherit a moneymaking business. Sustainable energy tech is now becoming cheaper than fossilised sunlight, and Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries and many of America's oil barons have lots of access to today's sunlight. They can't afford to ignore the money they can save by using today's sunlight instead of fossilised sunlight.
