Thanks Newtonian, I appreciate your thoughts. I must, however, endorse RonGlaeston's point--it's the built-in momentum, the unstoppability, that terrifies me and so many others. Having said that I do take a tiny bit of comfort from the other force you mention, that is, the future is stochastic as it the operation of the Earth System.
