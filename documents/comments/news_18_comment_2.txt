Tories have no principles whatsoever. They're all backing Liz Truss because she's clearly more popular with the party membership than Sunak, meaning that for the second time in a row they're backing a candidate they don't believe is up to the job. If the general public weren't making it clear that Johnson's behaviour repulsed them and would likely cost the Tories votes at the next general election, these same seals would still be slapping their fins together for The Funny Man. By what token can this be called "leadership"? The Tories are utterly reliant on public opinion to tell them what to do. There are no principles at play here, no morals, no plan for the country, no program of policies to address the barrage of challenges Britain is facing. All they can do is pay close attention to the newspapers and the polls and the whips, and decide from there which fatuous interpretation of reality they're going to pretend they believe in today.
