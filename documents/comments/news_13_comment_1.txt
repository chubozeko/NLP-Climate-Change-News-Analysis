Dear Mr Jacobs, Of course, a sustainable, egalitarian and wellbeing-focused economy would require a different approach altogether. Your final line is the killer: it is beyond the ideology, the competence and the desire of the current Conservative party to embrace such a different approach.  Even if Truss's "growth strategy" were significantly watered down - or even abandoned entirely - the love affair with unrestrained capitalism, the obsession with cutting 'red tape', the belief that private trumps public in every sphere, and the inability to understand how a modern society really functions, leaves them hamstrung from the get-go.  They must go - and soon.
