The war in Ukraine and Russias embargo or restrictions of oil and gas to the west, was a perfect opportunity to go for renewable energy in a big way. It seems to me that Truss and the Tories however are only concerned with finding nonrenewable sources as quickly as possible. I have heard no plan for long-term investment. It’s not even making the effort to help people cut down on their reliance of fossil fuel energy. The French are presently using public service announcements to this effect, the British are just putting their head in the sand and hoping that everything can go on as it used to, albeit with higher prices. It’s as though they don’t still get it that there is a climate crisis. The cost of an action is going to be absolutely massive.
