Truss doesn’t really have a strategy. She has a slogan. And by repeating the word "Growth" 27 times in a speech doesn’t add much meat to the bone. The problem for Truss is that she is an unreconstructed libertarian free marketeer. “Unreconstructed” because she has neither the wit nor the intellect to riff on a theme. To bend and sway. To take account of prevailing circumstances. To deal with the nuances of the real world. Truss is haplessly literal and unquestioning. There is no depth of understanding. No real substance. That is why with every pronouncement she appears so facile ….. a mere soundbite ahead of her audience.  She is a thick-fingered beginner-level flute player glued to sheet music trying to survive in a world of free form jazz.
