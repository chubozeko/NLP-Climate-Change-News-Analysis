The corruption is anchored in the income tax code. Capitalism is just an emergent phenomenon of markets. Put the actual cost of civilization at the actual decision points (sales tax) and pay people to stay home, build communities and contribute to places (UBI). We don't need a "climate and inflation" bill: we need an anti-consumptionism system.
