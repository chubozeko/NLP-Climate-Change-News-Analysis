Hi Clive, I have not only read all your books on climate change, but I have used them in my Honours Law thesis, and now in my PhD, which is looking at the 1992 Rio Declaration principles of sustainable development and how these need to be applied to develop laws and poilicies that will effectively address mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change, and hopefully save the world, and many lives. I also teach a Masters course, 'Politics of Climate Change'.  Some days, I am so depressed, I can hardly write a word, and often I am just a teary mess, but then I drag myself back to my keyboard because giving up is not an option. If I, someone totally obsessed with doing everything in my power to address cliamte change gives up, then how can I expect anyone else to pick up where I left off. I will continue to fight for climate justice until I am in my cardboard box. It was more fun, and I had more hope, with you fighting the good fight, but I understand how soul, and emotionally, destroying, beating your head against a fossil fuel wall can be. I wish you some peace and a good, well, earned rest.
