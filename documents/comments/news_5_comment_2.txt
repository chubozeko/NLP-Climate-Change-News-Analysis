This neo-lib fascination with markets is killing us. Not everything can be commodified. Even if something can be commodified, not every market operates in an ideal state. Unfettered capitalism is madness. Governments need to return to 'muscular regulation' as it is obvious most markets end up being gamed by the major players, leading to perverse and anti-competetive behaviours. Putting a price on the environment, whatever the intent, will end badly. Whenever they have priced something a perverse outcome has inevitably followed.
