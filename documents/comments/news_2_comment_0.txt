Thanks Spiz. In the mid-2000s we did an analysis at the Australia Institute that showed that, on average, each immigrant soon has double the emissions they would have had. So it does make a difference to global emissions. I don't know what the figures would be now, possibly less than a doubling but it depends on several factors.
