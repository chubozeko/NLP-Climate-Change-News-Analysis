It’s not as if some shady bloke in an old trench coat is hanging around on a street corner in the less desirable areas of the city whispering to the unwary, “Psst! I’ve got some spare pollution opportunities to sell if you’re interested”.Nah, this sort of stuff is traded in the boardrooms and marketplaces by besuited businessmen who broker million dollar deals before breakfast. The type of person who makes money in the trading irrespective of what the stock is or if it tanks or succeeds.Profiting from pollution is sort of what got us into this mess and somehow I can’t see it helping us get out of it.
